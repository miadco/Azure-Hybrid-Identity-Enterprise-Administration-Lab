# Azure Hybrid Identity & Enterprise Administration Lab

This project provides a step-by-step guide to building a foundational Hybrid Identity lab in Microsoft Azure. It is designed to be a superior alternative to local virtualization (like VirtualBox), providing hands-on experience in a realistic, enterprise-grade cloud environment.

The lab is structured in progressive phases, starting with a core setup and advancing to production-grade security and troubleshooting scenarios.

üìò Powered by Prompt Engineering  
This lab was designed, built, and documented in tandem with ChatGPT-4, demonstrating not just technical proficiency in IAM and cloud identity, but also advanced prompt engineering workflows for system planning, troubleshooting, and documentation.

Every step ‚Äî from idea to implementation ‚Äî reflects both my engineering skill and my ability to co-create effectively with AI.

## üéØ Objective

To build a functioning Microsoft Hybrid Identity environment by:

* Deploying a Windows Server Domain Controller in Azure.
* Synchronizing an on-premises Active Directory domain (corp.local) with Microsoft Entra ID.
* Simulating enterprise administration tasks, security policy implementation, and troubleshooting.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

* **Azure Account**: A Free Tier account is recommended, which includes a B1s VM and a \$200 credit for the first 30 days.
* **Basic Azure Portal Familiarity**: A general understanding of navigating the Azure portal.
* **Internet Connection**: Required for Remote Desktop (RDP) access.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup

### Step 1: Create the Windows Server 2022 VM

1. Log in to the Azure Portal: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Go to **Virtual Machines > Create > Azure virtual machine**.
3. Configure the VM:

   * **Resource group**: Create new > `HybridIdentityLab-RG`
   * **VM Name**: `HybridLab-DC`
   * **Region**: Pick your nearest (e.g., West US 3)
   * **Image**: Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition - Gen2
   * **Size**: Standard\_B1s (Free tier eligible) or Standard\_D2s\_v3 (if using credits).
   * **Username**: `labadmin`
   * **Password**: Create and save a strong password.
   * **Inbound Ports**: Allow RDP (3389)
   * **Disks**: Leave the default Standard SSD.
   * **Networking**: Leave the defaults to create a new VNet.
4. Click **Review + Create**, then **Create**.

### Step 2: Connect and Promote to a Domain Controller

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the VM and click **Connect > RDP**.
2. Download the RDP file and log in.
3. Open **Server Manager > Add Roles and Features**.
4. Install **Active Directory Domain Services**.
5. After installation, promote the server to a domain controller:

   * Select **Add a new forest** and enter `corp.local`.
   * Set a DSRM password and complete the wizard.
   * The server will restart.

### Step 3: Install and Configure Microsoft Entra Connect

1. Log in after the restart.
2. Disable IE Enhanced Security in Server Manager.
3. Download and install **Microsoft Entra Connect**.
4. Use the wizard to sync with your Entra ID tenant.
5. Create test users and OUs in **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

## üíùÔ∏è Phase 2: Add a Client Workstation (Optional)

### Create a Client VM

1. Create a second VM in `HybridIdentityLab-RG`:

   * **Name**: `Client-PC`
   * **Image**: Windows 10/11 Pro
   * **Size**: Standard\_B1s
   * **Networking**: Use same VNet as `HybridLab-DC`

### Join Client to Domain

1. Connect via RDP.
2. Go to **System Properties > Change settings > Change...**
3. Select **Domain** and enter `corp.local`.
4. Authenticate with domain admin credentials.
5. Restart VM and verify domain login.

## üõ°Ô∏è Phase 3: Production-Grade Lab Enhancements

### Tier 1: Refining Synchronization & Role Assignment

* **OU Filtering**: Configure in Entra Connect wizard to sync only specific OUs.
* **Group Sync**: Create AD security groups and confirm cloud replication.
* **Role Assignments**: Assign Entra roles (e.g., User Administrator) to synced users.

### Tier 2: Implementing Security Policies (Premium Features)

* **Conditional Access**: Require MFA for admins accessing Azure Portal.
* **SSPR with Password Writeback**:

  * Enable password writeback in Entra Connect.
  * Configure SSPR and test from client.

### Tier 3: Simulating and Recovering from Failures

* **Simulate Sync Failure**:

  * Stop Azure AD Sync service.
  * Create a new on-prem user and wait.
  * Confirm user is not synced.
* **Recovery**:

  * Use **Synchronization Service Manager** to check errors.
  * Restart the service.
  * Run PowerShell: `Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta`
  * Confirm successful sync.

## üìÜ Bonus: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* Navigate to `HybridIdentityLab-RG` in Azure Portal.
* Go to **Export Template** under Settings.
* Download the ARM Template (JSON).
* Optionally, convert to **Bicep** for cleaner syntax and reuse.

---

## üí∏ Cost Management

* **Shut Down VMs** when not in use to avoid compute charges.
* **Set Budgets** in Azure Cost Management + Billing.
* **Delete Resource Group** when lab is complete to remove all costs.
